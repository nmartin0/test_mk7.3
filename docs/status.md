# Where the work stands

**Nothing has been built yet.** Three trees run independently; none of
the design work in `docs/roadmap.md` has started. This file is honest
about that and will be rewritten as soon as it is not true.

`RULES.md` 7.1: an honest account of what is open ships with the work.
At this point the account is almost entirely open.

## What runs

| | state | measured |
|---|---|---|
| OSFMK 7.3 under QEMU, i386 | boots | by the maintainer, outside this repository |
| Lites on OSFMK 7.3 | runs | by the maintainer, outside this repository |
| the adaptation that makes it run | `tools/lites/lites-osfmk73.patch`, 1,414 lines across 29 files | `nmartin0/test_mk7.3`, `dev` |
| 4.4BSD-Lite2 (`nmartin0/4.4BSD-Lite2`, `dev3`) | standalone kernel, execs init, enters user mode | that tree's `docs/status.md` |

The third is the one with a published account. Its kernel mounts an FFS
root from a labelled disk, loads `/sbin/init`, enters user mode at
`cs=0x1f`, and takes a correctly handled page fault on init's first bss
write — after which the machine produces no further exceptions. That is
that project's open question, not this one's, but it bounds what the
personality can be expected to do when it arrives here.

## What has been established without building anything

All of it by `grep -rl` against the trees, in the session that recorded
it. Commands are in `docs/method.md` §7.

**Patience's mechanisms are already in OSFMK 7.3.** This is the single
most consequential finding so far, because it removes the kernel half
of the syscall work:

| mechanism | files in `osfmk7.3/osfmk` |
|---|---|
| `EXC_SYSCALL` = 7, `EXC_MACH_SYSCALL` = 8 | `mach/exception.h` |
| `EXCEPTION_DEFAULT` 1, `EXCEPTION_STATE` 2, `EXCEPTION_STATE_IDENTITY` 3 | same |
| `catch_exception_raise_state` | 9 |
| `thread_set_exception_ports` | 19 |
| `thread_swap_exception_ports` | 7 |
| `mach_msg_overwrite` | 20 |
| `vm_read_overwrite` | 14 |
| `vm_remap` | 20 |
| `mach_subsystem_create` | 9 |
| `mach_port_allocate_subsystem` | 16 |
| `rpc_subsystem` | 16 |
| `routine_descriptor` | 17 |
| `mig_stub_routine` | 5 |
| `thread_activation_create` | 10 |

**`THREAD_STATE_SYSCALL` is not.** `mach/i386/thread_status.h` defines
flavours 1 (`i386_THREAD_STATE`), 2 (`i386_FLOAT_STATE`), 3
(`i386_ISA_PORT_MAP_STATE`), 5 (`i386_REGS_SEGS_STATE`) and 8
(`i386_SAVED_STATE`). No syscall-specific small flavour. It is the one
kernel addition the design requires.

**The i386 collocated fast path is written.** `i386/i386_rpc.c`, 608
lines, and `i386/machine_rpc.h`, 225. `call_exc_serv()` transfers the
exception arguments to a new stack and performs a side-call to the
collocated server by `jmp`, returning through
`exception_return_wrapper()`.

**OSFMK 7.3 has no `mach_init` server.** `bootstrap.template` installs
as `/mach_servers/bootstrap.conf` and its default content is three
lines: `name_server`, `default_pager`, `startup`. The two literal
`/mach_servers/mach_init` strings in the tree are the same comment in
two copies of `servers/service.defs`. `mach_init.c` in `libmach` is the
per-task library initialiser.

**`bootstrap.template` names our target.** It refers to "the
`osf1_server` (conventionally called `startup`)" and documents its
arguments: `-s` single-user, `-a` prompt for root device, and a root
filesystem name.

**Six of those 29 files are files Tier 1 rewrites**: `server/serv/`'s
`user_copy.c`, `serv_syscalls.c`, `server_init.c`, `server_exec.c`,
`xmm_interface.c` and `vn_pager_misc.c`. The other 23 are the
adaptation proper and are Tier 0 work already done.

**Lites and OSF's `uxkern/` share 31 filenames** and both declare MIG
`subsystem bsd_1 101000`, OSF with 75 routines and Lites with 68.

**Lites is 79% unchanged from stock 4.4BSD-Lite2** across 88 shared
files, comments stripped. Per directory: netinet 97.4%, ufs/ffs 86.2%,
ufs/ufs 80.1%, kern 73.6%, nfs 63.5%.

**Those similarity figures were measured against stock Lite2, not
against `bsd/`.** The maintainer reports `dev3` is more functional than
stock and fixes many bugs. The delta has not been measured and the
figures above should not be quoted about this repository until it has.

## What has not been checked and should be, first

Both are greps, both take minutes, and both change the shape of Tier 1
if they fire.

1. **Does Lites allocate per-thread state at a constant offset from a
   fixed-size C-threads stack?** The OSF/1 server did this with
   `uthread`, which forced Utah's kernel to hand the server its own
   service stack rather than reuse the kernel stack. Lites shares the
   C-threads heritage.
2. **Do Lites' generated stubs copy arguments the BSD service routines
   already copy?** Utah found every argument moving twice, because the
   personality came from a monolithic kernel and does its own
   `copyin`/`copyout`.

Neither has been measured here. Both are recorded in Utah's paper as
costing them real time.

## What is open and has no answer anywhere

- `getsysinfo` operations the vendor marked "for internal use only".
- `sysinfo` commands beyond 9, which Linux's own source flags as
  unpublished.
- The OSF/1 MK 6/7 single server source: confirmed never publicly
  released. OSF RI said why — the latest OSF/1 versions "are encumbered
  by commercial licenses", which is why they wrote MkLinux's server
  instead.
- `ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/opengroup/ri/`, the OSF RI publications mirror,
  never enumerated. One file from it is the best architecture document
  this project has.
